Server recently become very fragile and slow   Deploying code could bring server down when cache clear  Logged in editors suffer longer delay when editing content for unknown reason     Deployment requires many coordination   Webteam is not able to deploy to staging and live environment and has to rely on other person who has greater priviledge, which makes deployment very inflexible.     Isolation for testing new feature is cumbersome    Limited access and total control   When something goes wrong, webteam may not be able to pingpoint the problem quickly due to limit access and deploy quick fix to the problem.

For example, news_item content type has an image field, which should be a entity reference field in D8, therefore, it needs to be recreated. Also make sure the machine name is mapped to the old type field name.\n\n\nMake sure to export all the configs as code \ndrush config-export -y\n. This will save all the config in the ../config directory\n\n\nStart content migration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the \nConfig Installer\n to import site profile is the easiest way for manage site structure\n\n\n\n\nOnce the site structure is ready, use \ndrush config-export -y\n to export entire site configs\n\n\nInstall Drupal as usual, but using the minimal profile\n\n\nRun \nfin drush site-install --verbose config_installer config_installer_sync_configure_form.sync_directory=../config --yes\n to re-install the site based on config files in the sync directory\n\n\nOnce it is completed, the srceen will show the user name and password. In case that is not working, Use \nfin drush upwd admin --password=\nadmin\n to reset admin password\n\n\n\n\nMigration Note\n\n\nTo set up a new dev site with content, we could modify the script (migrationclean.sh) to:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the config profile\n\n\nThen run run-migration.sh to import site content\n\n\n\n\nField collection to Paragraphs\n\n\nParagraphs has most of the code to migrate field collections. And this is the plan based on the community discussion.\n\n\nAccording to @mikelutz\n\n\n\n\nIf you install the latest paragraphs -dev and apply \nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2911244\n  it\nshould migrate through the migrate_drupal_ui\n\n\n\n\nThere are couple threads related to this:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2911244\n\n\nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2897021\n\n\n\n\nBasic page migration\n\n\nbenjifisher [2:02 PM]\nI think you want the \nmerge\n plugin: \nhttps://cgit.drupalcode.org/migrate_plus/tree/src/Plugin/migrate/process/Merge.php\n\n\nThere might be an easier way, but if you want to follow the model in the docblock, then you can create three separate migrations, each of which creates a Paragraph entity from one of the source fields. Then use \nmigration_lookup\n and \nmerge\n as in the sample code in the docblock. Remember that \niterator\n is deprecated; use \nsub_process\n instead. (edited)\n\n\nBlock reference\n\n\nBlock reference is not support in D8. There are discussions propose how this should work in D8 but there\ns no agreement\nyet.

For example, news_item content type has an image field, which should be a entity reference field in D8, therefore, it needs to be recreated. Also make sure the machine name is mapped to the old type field name.  Make sure to export all the configs as code  drush config-export -y .

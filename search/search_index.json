For example, news_item content type has an image field, which should be a entity reference field in D8, therefore, it needs to be recreated. Also make sure the machine name is mapped to the old type field name.\n\n\nMake sure to export all the configs as code \ndrush config-export -y\n. This will save all the config in the ../config directory\n\n\nStart content migration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the \nConfig Installer\n to import site profile is the easiest way for manage site structure\n\n\n\n\nOnce the site structure is ready, use \ndrush config-export -y\n to export entire site configs\n\n\nInstall Drupal as usual, but using the minimal profile\n\n\nRun \nfin drush site-install --verbose config_installer config_installer_sync_configure_form.sync_directory=../config --yes\n to re-install the site based on config files in the sync directory\n\n\nOnce it is completed, the srceen will show the user name and password. In case that is not working, Use \nfin drush upwd admin --password=\nadmin\n to reset admin password\n\n\n\n\nMigration Note\n\n\nTo set up a new dev site with content, we could modify the script (migrationclean.sh) to:\n1. Install the config profile\n2. Then run run-migration.sh to import site content\n\n\nField collection to Paragraphs\n\n\nParagraphs has most of the code to migrate field collections. And this is the plan based on the community discussion.\n\n\nAccording to @mikelutz\n\n\n\n\nIf you install the latest paragraphs -dev and apply \nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2911244\n  it\nshould migrate through the migrate_drupal_ui\n\n\n\n\nThere are couple threads related to this:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2911244\n\n\nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2897021\n\n\n\n\nBasic page migration\n\n\nbenjifisher [2:02 PM]\nI think you want the \nmerge\n plugin: \nhttps://cgit.drupalcode.org/migrate_plus/tree/src/Plugin/migrate/process/Merge.php\n\n\nThere might be an easier way, but if you want to follow the model in the docblock, then you can create three separate migrations, each of which creates a Paragraph entity from one of the source fields. Then use \nmigration_lookup\n and \nmerge\n as in the sample code in the docblock. Remember that \niterator\n is deprecated; use \nsub_process\n instead. (edited)\n\n\nBlock reference\n\n\nBlock reference is not support in D8. There are discussions propose how this should work in D8 but there\ns no agreement\nyet. See \nDrupal 8 Port\n\n\nThe \nBlock Field\n seems work as an alternative.\n\n\nCKeditor - Embeded media\n\n\nMedia module is in Drupal core \n= 8.5. Ckeditor can work with Media Embed module for embeding many types of media eneity inside a ckeditor. Refer to the \nmedia guide section\n for more info.\n\n\nIn order to make legacy embeded string work, some process transformations is needed. This transformation will convert the legacy embeded string into a new string that is regonizabled by the new editor.\n\n\n# Old Embeded String\n[[{\nfid\n:\n41966\n,\nview_mode\n:\n190wide\n,\nfields\n:{\nalt\n:\nAlt - Chinese New Year \n,\ntitle\n:\nTitle - Chinese New\nYear\n,\nstyle\n:\nfloat: right;\n,\nclass\n:\nmedia-element my_custom_class\nfile-teaser\n,\ndata-delta\n:\n1\n,\nformat\n:\n190wide\n,\nfield_file_caption[und][0][value]\n:\nHappy Chinese New\nYear\n,\nfield_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\n:\nAlt - Chinese New Year\n\n,\nfield_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\n:\nTitle - Chinese New\nYear\n},\ntype\n:\nmedia\n,\nfield_deltas\n:{\n1\n:{\nalt\n:\nAlt - Chinese New Year \n,\ntitle\n:\nTitle - Chinese New\nYear\n,\nstyle\n:\nfloat: right;\n,\nclass\n:\nmedia-element my_custom_class\nfile-teaser\n,\ndata-delta\n:\n1\n,\nformat\n:\n190wide\n,\nfield_file_caption[und][0][value]\n:\nHappy Chinese New\nYear\n,\nfield_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\n:\nAlt - Chinese New Year\n\n,\nfield_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\n:\nTitle - Chinese New Year\n}},\nattributes\n:{\nalt\n:\nAlt - Chinese New Year\n\n,\ntitle\n:\nTitle - Chinese New Year\n,\nstyle\n:\nfloat: left;\n,\nclass\n:\nmedia-element my_custom_class\nfile-190wide\n,\ndata-delta\n:\n1\n}}]]\n\n\n# New Embeded String\n\ndrupal-entity data-align=\nleft\n data-caption=\nHappy Chinese New Year\n data-entity-type=\nmedia\n\ndata-entity-uuid=\n302905a2-3598-433b-9fa2-143fbaac4b98\n data-entity-embed-display=\nentity_reference:media_thumbnail\n\ndata-embed-button=\nmedia_browser_button\n data-entity-embed-display-settings=\n{\nimage_style\n:\n190wide\n}\n  /\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the FixMediaTags.php from the nyulaw_migrate module to understand how th process works.\n\n\nIf after migrated content the front end doesn\nt render html tag correctly.
